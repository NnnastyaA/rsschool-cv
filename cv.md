# Briefly About Myself:

In June of this year I receive a diploma of graduation from the university. Until recently, I was sure that I would work as a profession - a primary school teacher. At the moment, there are a lot of people in my environment who are familiar with programming and work in IT. Gradually, this area began to attract interest from me. At the moment I have no experience, but there is a desire to learn and learn something new.I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer/

# Code example:

```
function reverse (n) {
    let module = Math.abs(n);
    let numberAsString = module.toString();

    return numberAsString.split("").reverse().join("");
}
```
