# Briefly About Myself:

She graduated from the Pedagogical University with a degree in primary education. After working at school, I realized that this was not my thing at all. It so happened that in my environment there are a lot of people who are connected with the IT sphere. I decided to take courses from rs.school in the summer, but in the end there was not enough time for them. Now I have dropped out of school and definitely decided to connect my life with programming. This is my second attempt and hopefully successful.

# Code example:

```
function towelSort (matrix) {
  let array = [];

  if (matrix){
    for (let i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
      if (i % 2 == 0) {
        for (let j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
          array.push(matrix[i][j]);
        }
      }
      else {
        for (let j = matrix[i].length - 1; j >= 0; j--){
          array.push(matrix[i][j]);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return array;
}

```
